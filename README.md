📸🔐 imageCypher
A secure image encryption and decryption tool built with Node.js and React. It uses XOR cipher encryption with randomly generated keys, and verifies key integrity using SHA-256 hash verification. Designed to safely share images over potentially insecure platforms like WhatsApp or cloud storage.

📌 Features
📷 Encrypt images using XOR cipher

🔑 Generate Base64-encoded encryption keys

📝 Generate and store SHA-256 hash for key verification

🖥️ Drag-and-drop user interface

🌙 Dark mode toggle support

📦 Automatic download of encrypted image, key, and hash as ZIP

✅ Key hash verification before decryption

🧹 Secure cleanup by deleting hash file after decryption

📽️ Why imageCypher?
While messaging apps like WhatsApp offer end-to-end encryption for messages and images during transit, once files are downloaded to a device or shared via other platforms, their security can be compromised.

## imageCypher ensures:

The image is securely encrypted before sending.

Only the intended recipient with the correct key can decrypt it.

The integrity of the key is verified before decryption using a SHA-256 hash.

No residual hash files are left after decryption.

⚙️ How it Works
Encryption

Upload an image.

A random key (same size as image data) is generated.

Image is encrypted with XOR cipher.

Key is Base64-encoded and saved.

SHA-256 hash of key is generated and saved.

Decryption

Encrypted image and key are uploaded.

SHA-256 hash is recomputed from the key.

Hash is compared with the stored hash.

If matched, image is decrypted.

Hash file is deleted after successful decryption.

📦 Installation


🚀 Usage
Start backend server.

Start frontend React app.

Use drag-and-drop UI to encrypt or decrypt images.

Download encrypted files, key, and hash as ZIP.

Share encrypted image and key separately.

🛡️ Security Note
This tool provides application-level encryption and integrity checking. While XOR cipher is simple, combining it with proper key management and hash verification significantly improves the safety of image sharing.
